# A-Diet-Menu-Recommendation-System

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

In the modern life, we tend to ignore the nutritional balance in our daily diet. The system will be able to help us by recommending a menu that balances our nutritional needs based on the data of our diet.


## Background
I want to solve the following problem:
"Eating only what you like and having an unbalanced nutrition".
It is important to have balanced nutrition for living long healthy.



## How is it used?

In advance, the system needs to be installed in a device such as smartphone and tablet so that the system gather information about our nutritional balance in our diet from pictures of our meal taken by such devices.
At first, we take a picture of our meal when we eat something, from daily diet to snacking. Then, system will calculate the value of nutrition included in the meal, and suggest a meal menu that is tailored to the rest of the mutritional balance we should be consuming that day.
This system will be needed by people who are living alone or who have kids.


## Challenges

This system can only RECOMMEND a nutritional balanced menu. It depends on whether we practically have a diet just recommended by the system. It is needed another education for us(especially for living alone people) to have nutritional balanced diets.

## What next?

This system will be more strong by being executed with a housekeeping robots. It is difficult to deny to eat the meal made by someone else, so we can maybe have nutritional balanced diets letting robots make meals that are recommended by the system.
